--How long did you spend working on this project?

I spent a couple hours working on this project.


--What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Creating methods from scratch that I'm used to ActiveRecord supplying was interesting and rewarding to me. Figuring out how to do #all and the validations was a fun challenge that I'm glad I did.


--What two additional features did you build? Why?

I added an instance method to the Product class which returns the number of times the product's been sold. I also added a class method to Product where each product and the number of times that product's been sold are returned as key value pairs in a hash. This makes it easy to see at a glace how much items are selling.

I added a purchase history method to Customer instances. This way, an individual customer's past purchases can easily be accessed. This data could be useful for recognizing trends among buyers.


--Where do you still have room to grow?

I could use some more experience creating/raising custom Error classes.
